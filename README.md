Impact: 78.5% baseline recovery rate with potential for 95%+ optimization.

#### 2. Contract Performance & Provider Network Optimization
Challenge: 912 high-risk providers with inconsistent payment performance.<br>
Solution: Provider contract performance analysis, risk stratification, and targeted intervention strategies.<br>
Impact: Provider-specific optimization programs targeting $67M in performance improvements.

#### 3. Operational Workflow Efficiency
Challenge: 61.56% first-pass resolution rate causing operational inefficiencies.<br>
Solution: Process bottleneck analysis, authorization lag optimization, and workflow automation recommendations.<br>
Impact: Projected 90%+ first-pass resolution through systematic process improvements.

#### 4. Pricing Strategy & Reimbursement Optimization
Challenge: 78.46% average payment rate indicating pricing/negotiation gaps.<br>
Solution: Specialty-specific pricing analysis, competitive benchmarking, and rate optimization strategies.<br>
Impact: Evidence-based pricing models supporting 15%+ margin improvements.

#### 5. Accounts Receivable & Cash Flow Management
Challenge: 45.72 days in AR significantly impacting cash flow.<br>
Solution: AR aging analysis, payment velocity optimization, and automated collection workflows.<br>
Impact: Projected reduction to 28-30 days AR representing $52M+ cash acceleration.

#### 6. Denial Management & Appeals Optimization
Challenge: 20% appeal success rate with substantial recovery potential.<br>
Solution: Denial pattern analysis, automated appeal prioritization, and success rate optimization.<br>
Impact: Systematic approach targeting 65%+ appeal success rates.
